FRAGMENTS
=========
- Can be added via hardcoded XML (FrameLayout) or in the code
- May be null or already in a list under FragmentManager; if null, needs to be created via fragmentManager.beginTransaction().add(int, Fragment).commit()
- Compatibility: Need to subclass FragmentActivity, because Activity will not have fragment support
- onAttach() -> [onCreate()] -> onCreateView() -> onActivityCreated() -> ... -> onDestroyView() -> [onDestroy()] -> onDetach
-- The only time fragments are not destroyed - and even then, retained only for a short period of time - is when setRetainInstance(true) has been called and the host activity is being destroyed for a configuration change (typically rotation)
- Attaching data to fragment - Must be done after fragment creation but before adding to activity:
public class MyFragment {
	public static MyFragment newInstance(data) {
		Bundle args = new Bundle();
		args.putString(KEY, string); <-- Method depends on datatype

		MyFragment fragment = new MyFragment();
		fragment.setArguments(args);
		return fragment;
	}
 }
-- Vs. intent data: intent.putExtra(KEY, anyObject)
- Updating fragment listview: onResume() { super.onResume(); ((Adapter) getListAdapter()).notifyDataSetChanged(); }
- startActivityForResult(intent, requestCode) // onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, intentWithExtras) { if (resultCode == Activity.RESULT_OK) ... }

ACTIVITIES
==========
- 

LAYOUTS
=======
- Attributes with "layout_" are directions to the widget's parent
-- E.g. layout_gravity positions a widget relative to its parent, while gravity positions the widget's own content
- 

OTHERS
======
- Use sp (Scale-Independent Pixels, based on screen density and user font size preference) for fonts and dp (Density-Independent Pixels, based on screen density) for everything else
- Adding external projects with resources: Navigate to folder, then use android update project --target <target_ID> --path . to generate build.xml
-- Remember to add ;C:\Program Files\Android\android-sdk\tools as a Windows environment variable
- Use AsyncTask only for short operations. Explanation: http://stackoverflow.com/a/13082084
